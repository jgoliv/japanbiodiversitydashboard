This dashboard is a Shiny R application that offers an interactive visualization of Japan's biodiversity from 1976 to 2024, showcasing observations of a wide variety of species.

The data used is the [occurence dataset](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?dataset_key=8a863029-f435-446a-821e-275f4f641165),
from the *Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)*, an international network and data infrastructure which provides open access to data about all types of life on Earth.

The application is deployed on shinyapps.io: [https://jgoliv.shinyapps.io/japanbiodiversitydashboard/](https://jgoliv.shinyapps.io/japanbiodiversitydashboard/)
